# Music Streaming and Storage Webapp

After using Dropbox, Soundcloud, Spotify, and my phone's native file system to listen to personal music files that I had collected on my PC, I found no ideal solution to enjoy these files seamlessly from my phone or PC. Then, while listening to a playlist on Spotify that utilized their Auto-mix feature, I thought, 'What an amazing feature! I want to use this,' but unfortunately, this feature is only available for select playlists created by Spotify themselves. This led me to embark on the journey of building a web app that enables me to listen to my own music files from anywhere and offers additional playlist customization options that other platforms do not provide.
