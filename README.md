# Music Streaming and Storage Webapp

Music storage and streaming webapp.
Users can create account, upload personal .mp3 or .wav files, configure playlists, configure crossfade.
  After using Dropbox, Soundlcoud, Spotify, and my phone's own filesystem to listen to personal music files I had collected on my PC, I had found no great way to listen to these files from my phone or PC. Then, after listening to a playlist on Spotify that used their Auto-mix feature, I thought, what an amazing feature, I want to use this, but sadly this feature is only available for select Spotify-made playlists. Thus, I set out to build web app that allows me to listen to my own music files anywhere and have extra playlist customization that other platforms do not provide.
